# Overview

batMods fits a number of discrete time stochastic models of varying structures with and without seasonal forces, to observed bat virus data (currently from boonah australia [@field2015spatiotemporal]), using particle MCMC based methods. The goal is to identify which dynamical model best represents the observed viral samples from wild populations and gain further insight into between-host viral dynamics in bats. 
Model comparison is conducted used an approximate leave one out cross validation algorithm, incorporating Pareto smoothed importance sampling [@VehtariLooPackage]. This algorithm uses pointwise likelihood values to compute the log pointwise predictive density and its  Monte Carlo standard error, the effective number of parameters, Pareto k diagnostic values (which can help assess if a model is well specified) and an information criterion "looic" (lower values suggest a better model fit).  [@vehtari2017practical;@vehtari2015pareto;@AkiLoo].

- Currently batMods fits three primary models structures with and without maternal immmunity and seasonal forces (figure 1) to multiple data-types, including serology and PCR data. 

 - The analysis can be run from the runscript.R file.

 - The metropilis hastings and particle filter algorithms run in R, whilst the model itself runs in C code, which is implemented via the Odin package. 

 - The model and fitting methods are described below. 

 - This is a work in progress as part of a paper on bat virus dynamics, as such should not be seen as a final analysis

Births occur in seasonal pulses, as previously described [@peel2014effect], with timing, amplitude and seasonality derived from three parameters in a modified Gaussian function.

\begin{align}
b(t) = c\exp^{s \cos^2(\pi t - \phi)}
\end{align}


$\beta$ is derived from a rearrangement of equation (2) in the main text, here $N$ is considered an upper limit to the population, thus $N$ is equal to the carrying capacity $\kappa$:
\begin{align}
\beta = R_0\bigg(\frac{(\epsilon+m)(\gamma+m+\rho)-\epsilon\rho}{N(\epsilon+m)}\bigg)
\end{align}
\hfill\break


__Stochastic transitions between states__

Movement between states at each discrete time-step (set as 0.25 days) for individuals is a stochastic process, using a combination of binomial, and multinomial distributions where multiple transition possibilities occur. 

e.g. for bats exiting the variable state $R$, transitions will occur with the following steps:

- The total number of individuals transitioning between states is determined by first summing all of the rates of exiting a current state, e.g. $(R \to exit)=\omega+\frac{N}{\kappa}$. 

- We then convert the sum of rates to a probability for each possible transition occurring during a single time-step, e.g. for a rate $x$, the equivalent probability of transition in one time-step is $p = 1-e^{-x}$, thus $Pr(R \to exit) = 1-e^{-(R \to exit)}$

- For each individual, a random draw from a binomial distribution is then performed at each time-step to obtain the number of individuals exiting $R$ e.g. $R_e = bin(R,Pr(R \to exit))$.  

- The relative probabilities are then computed for transition to each of the potential states
<br>
\begin{align}
  Pr(R\to S) = \frac{\omega}{m\frac{N}{\kappa}+\omega}
\end{align}
  <br>and <br>
\begin{align}
  Pr(R\to death) = \frac{m\frac{N}{\kappa}}{m\frac{N}{\kappa}+\omega}
\end{align}

-  A multinomial distribution is used with each probability to determine the destination of each individual $M (R_e,Pr(R\to S),Pr(R\to death))$
\hfill\break



# Model fitting 

The models are considered state-space (hidden Markov) models, with observations $k$ and hidden state variables $Z$ at time $t$ and we seek to identify an unbiased estimate of the likelihood value, (also known as a marginal likelihood) $pr(k|\theta)$, by essentially "marginalising out" ($Z$). Here we do this using a particle markov chain monte carlo (pMCMC) algorithm. Which combines a particle filter as an unbiased estimator of the marginal likelihood value, and an MCMC acceptence/rejection algorithm [@andrieu2010particle].

# pMCMC generic example

Particle filters act as an unbiased estimator of marginal likelihood by applying a form of importance re-sampling, to generate an approximate sample from, and make inferences about an unobserved Markov process [@smith2013sequential]. They are becoming popular in disciplines where state-space models are common such as ecology and epidemiology [@kantas2015particle;@peters2010ecological;@knape2012fitting;@fasiolo2016comparison;@sheinson2014comparison].

In brief, the marginal likelihood $pr(k|\theta)$ for the observed data $k$, the hidden state $Z$ and the parameter vector $\theta$ is considered the joint posterior probability $pr(k|Z,\theta)*p(Z|\theta)$. Using Monte-Carlo approximation for $p(k|\theta)$, a particle filter with $j$ particles which have the possible trajectories/evolution of $Z_j$, the marginal likelihood can be considered as $pr(k | \theta) \approx \sum_{J} pr\left(k | Z_{j}, \theta\right) * pr\left(Z_{j} | \theta\right)$.

To run the particle filter algorithm requires the following steps:

1. Initialise the particles with equal weights.
\begin{align}
\begin{array}{l}{Z_{j} \sim pr\left(Z_{j} | \theta\right)} \\ {w_{j}=\frac{1}{J}}\end{array}
\end{align}
\hfill\break

2. For each particle j at time t, simulate the initial conditions at the first observed data point.
\begin{align}
Z_{j t} \sim pr\left(Z_{j t} | Z_{j}, \theta\right)
\end{align}
\hfill\break

3. Calculate a probability weighting for each particle based on the results of the simulation and the observed data.
\begin{align}
w_{j t}=pr\left(k_{t} | Z_{j}, \theta\right)
\end{align}
\hfill\break

4. The marginal likelihood for this data point can be considered the average of each particle weighting.
\begin{align}
p\left(k_{t} | \theta\right)=\frac{1}{J} \sum_{J} w_{j t}
\end{align}
\hfill\break

5. Normalise the weightings $\frac{w_{jt}}{(\sum_Jw_{jt} )}$, resample with replacement each particle based on their weighting and simulate forward to the next observed data point.
\begin{align}
Z_{j t+1} \sim pr\left(Z_{j t+1} | Z_{t}, \theta\right)
\end{align}
\hfill\break

Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all observed data, an estimate for the total marginal likelihood value can be considered the product of the average particle weights at each observed timepoint.
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} (\theta|k_{1: n} )=\displaystyle\prod_{t=1}^n \left(\frac{1}{J} \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^J w_{jt}\right)
\end{align}
\hfill\break

This marginal likelihood value is then used in a traditional MCMC algorithm, in this instance Metropolis-Hastings, where rejection or acceptance of a parameter proposal is based on the current and previous marginal likelihood values. 

__Model fitting with pMCMC to Boonah bat data__

To fit the model with pMCMC to our observed data, we developed a likelihood function which incorporated the three unique longitudinal data-types; Individual serology for Hendra virus antibodies, individual PCR of urine for Hendra virus RNA, and under roost PCR of urine for Hendra virus RNA.


- _Firstly, we consider the observed data:_

  If the sampling time points are $i_1...i_n$, the number of individual samples through time are $N_{i...n}$ of which $k^p_{i...n}$ are PCR positive and $k^s_{i...n}$ are seropositive, the number of under-roost urine samples is $N^u_{i...n}$ of which $k^u_{i...n}$ are PCR positive.

- _Secondly, the hidden state:_

  If the system state of the model at each time point is $Z_{i...n}$, the transition probability density function for $Z$ from the stochastic model, conditioned on the parameters $\theta$, is $pr(Z_i|Z_{i-1},\theta)$.


Below we define how each data type contributes to the likelihood function in detail:
\newpage 


\hfill\break
\newpage 

*__Individual serological and PCR of urine samples__*

In the observed data, individual bats are found to be in all four empirical states of serological and PCR positivity:

- 	PCR positive and seropositive ($k^{P^+S^+}$)
- 	PCR negative and seropositive ($k^{P^-S^+}$)
- 	PCR positive and seronegative ($k^{P^+S^-}$)
- 	PCR negative and seronegative ($k^{P^-S^-}$)

Logically, a relationship between the PCR and serology states is likely and so we consider a joint conditional probability function rather than treating the data as independent. Transitory states and test detection failure are also considered by fitting the coefficients $\zeta_s$ and $\zeta_p$ which are bounded between 0 and 1. Thus, the simulated implementation of each observed empirical state are as follows:

- 	$k^{P^+S^+}$: Bats are assumed to be in the I state of the model and are equivalent to the number of I state bats proportionate to the value of the coefficients; $z^{P^+S^+}=I\zeta_p\zeta_s$

- 	$k^{P^-S^+}$: Bats are assumed to be in either the L or R states of the models, or in the I state of the model; $z^{P^-S^+}=(I+L+R)\zeta_s(1-\zeta_p)$

- 	$k^{P^+S^-}$: Bats are considered to be in the I state of the model; $z^{P^+S^-}=I(1-\zeta_s)\zeta_p$

- 	$k^{P^-S^-}$: Bats are assumed to be in the S state of the models or in the I state; $z^{P^-S^-}=I(1-\zeta_s)(1-\zeta_p)+S$


If $k$ is a vector of the observed counts of bats in each empirical state, $k=(k^{P^+S^+},k^{P^-S^+},k^{P^+S^-},k^{P^-S^-})$, $z$ is a vector of the simulated prevalences of each state $z=(z^{P^+S^+},z^{P^-S^+},z^{P^+S^-},z^{P^-S^-})$ and $N$ is the total observed bats, we can then propose a joint probability function based on a multinomial distribution, $pr(k^p,k^s|Z,N)$.

\begin{align}
pr(k^p,k^s|Z) = \frac{N!}{\prod_{j=1}^{4}k_j!} \displaystyle\prod_{j=1}^{4}z_j^{k_j}
\end{align}


*__Pooled under roost samples__*

If the probability of at least one bat within a pooled urine sample of $x$ individuals being PCR positive for virus RNA can be considered $P_t=1-(1-p)^x$, where $p$ is the probability of each individual bat contributing to a pool being positive [@chiang1962statistical]. The result of PCR testing on a pooled sample ($T_i$) will be one of two states, with the following probabilities:
\begin{align}
T_i=\left\{\begin{array}{l}positive = 1-(1-p)^x\\ negative = (1-p)^x\end{array}\right.
\end{align}

<!-- Nu(t) samples, of whichXu(t)were positive -->
<!--   #prob of Nu positives, given Xu samples and state of model Z -->
<!--   #Pt is the probability of a pooled sample being positive -->
<!--   #p is the probability of a bat being positive, x is the number of bats contributing -->
<!--   #p is sampled from Z, as the prevalence of infectious (I/N) -->
<!--   #x is a poison dist variable -->

Therefore, assuming that any one under-roost sample comes from $x$ bats with a prevalence of $p$, considering the model state $Z(t)$, we aim to identify the likelihood of the contribution of positive under-roost samples at time ($t$) given (from the predicted GAM values) the number of samples $N^u(t)$, of which $k^u(t)$ were positive, $pr(k^u|N^u,Z)$. As the predicted values from the GAM are for prevalence, the total number of bats ($N^u(t)$) was considered the mean number of samples collected on each sampling occasion. 

Due to the nature and challenges of field-sampling, under-roost data is likely to contain a degree of overdispersion, as it is highly exposed to external factors which are difficult to account for in study design. Therefore, the probability is unlikely to follow a standard binomial distribution, where the variance is defined by the mean. To account for this, we used a probability function based around a beta-binomial distribution, which allows for an additional variance parameter to be fitted to account for any overdispersion in the observations. A beta-binomial distribution, is a binomial distribution such $pr(k^u|N^u,Z)$ would be:

\begin{align}
pr(k^u|N^u,Z)={N^i \choose k^u}p_t^{k^u}(1-p_t)^{N^u-k^u}
\end{align}

However, $p_t$ is not constant and is generated from a beta distribution, which takes two shape parameters $\alpha$ and  $\beta$, $beta(\alpha,\beta)$ thus;

\begin{align}
pr(k^u|N^u,Z) = \frac{{N^u \choose k^u}beta(k^u+O_up, N^u-k^u+O_u(1-p_t))}{beta(O_up, O_u(1-p_t))}
\end{align}

Here, $O_u$ accounts for overdispersion in the data, and the prevalence of infectious bats $p$ in $p_t$ is derived from the model state $Z(t)$ as $\frac{I(t)\zeta_u}{N(t)}$, where $\zeta_u$ is a fitted coefficient accounting for detection failure.

As there is no precise measure of exact bat numbers contributing to a pooled sample, $x$ is a fitted parameter with a prior based on expert knowledge and estimates from the field. For simplicity, only one value of $x$ is derived for all pools on a single sampling occasion, assuming that each pooled sample on average has the same number of bats contributing. We also assume that there is no effect of pooling on the diagnostic tests, and any that does occur should be primarily accounted for by the $\zeta_u$ coefficient.



*__full likelihood function__*

Considering the above, and the sampling time points ($i$), we can define the full likelihood function as:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} (\theta|N,N^u,k^{(s,p,u)}) =pr(\theta)* \displaystyle\prod_{i = 1}^{16} pr(k^s_i,k^p_i|N_i,Z_i)*pr(k^u_t|N^u_i,Z_i)
\end{align}

__Initial conditions__

Starting parameters are estimated by running a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm with a deterministic version of the model for 50,000 iterations with a 10,000 iteration burn-in. The median parameter set from each posterior distribution was then used in the pMCMC.

Initial conditions for the bat population are derived from the carrying capacity parameter ($\kappa$). A population equal to the carrying capacity is first assumed and this is then split into demographic compartments as follows:

\begin{align}
N=\kappa
\end{align}

\begin{align}
b=(\omega_m + m_j)\frac{m_j+\mu}{\omega_m}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
S_F = 0.5 \biggl(\frac{N}{\frac{1+m}{\mu}+\frac{b}{\omega_m+m_j}}\biggr)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
S_M = 0.5 \biggl(\frac{N}{\frac{1+m}{\mu}+\frac{b}{\omega_m+m_j}}\biggr)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
S_J = (S_F+S_M) \frac{m}{mu}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
S_N = N - S_M - S_F - S_J
\end{align}


Infectious and exposed individuals are added as 5% of the population and the model is run for 50 years to reach an equilibrium before fitting to the first data point.
