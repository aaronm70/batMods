batMods fits a number of discrete time stochastic models of varying
structures with and without seasonal forces, to observed bat virus data
(currently from boonah australia (Field et al. 2015)), using particle
MCMC based methods. The goal is to identify which dynamical model best
represents the observed viral samples from wild populations and gain
further insight into between-host viral dynamics in bats. Model
comparison is conducted using an approximate leave one out cross
validation algorithm, incorporating Pareto smoothed importance sampling
(Vehtari et al. 2019). This algorithm uses pointwise likelihood values
to compute the log pointwise predictive density and its Monte Carlo
standard error, the effective number of parameters, Pareto k diagnostic
values (which can help assess if a model is well specified) and an
information criterion “looic” (lower values suggest a better model fit).
(Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry 2017a, 2017b; Vehtari et al. 2015).

  - Currently batMods fits three primary models structures with and
    without maternal immmunity and seasonal forces (figure 1) to
    multiple data-types, including serology and PCR data.

  - The analysis can be run from the runscript.R file.

  - The metropilis hastings and particle filter algorithms run in R,
    whilst the model itself runs in C code, which is implemented via the
    Odin package.

  - The model and fitting methods are described in modelMethods.pdf
    <https://github.com/aaronm70/batMods/blob/master/modelMethods.pdf>

  - This is a work in progress as part of a paper on bat virus dynamics,
    as such should not be seen as a final analysis <br>
